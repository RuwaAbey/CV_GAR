# Final_Year_Project_G09
# Computer Vision Based Group Activity Detection

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a computer vision system for detecting and classifying group activities in videos or images. The project leverages deep learning techniques to analyze group interactions, such as talking, walking, or playing sports, using video or image data. The system is designed for researchers and developers interested in activity recognition and computer vision applications.

## Features
- **Group Activity Detection**: Identifies and classifies activities performed by groups in video sequences or images.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Utilizes state-of-the-art architectures (e.g., CNNs, RNNs, Transformers or 3D convolutional networks) for feature extraction and classification.
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Includes scripts for preparing video or image data for model training and inference.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Provides tools to evaluate model performance using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
